        "0Swift: You can use the button skip button an unlimited amount of times whenever you feel stuck." +
        "0Swift: The timer helps you keep track of how long it is taking you to complete each puzzle." +
        "0Swift: Alright. Now that is cleared away. I want you to notice all these numbers that are displayed.&" +
        "0Swift: These numbers tell you how to put the puzzle together. Now look at the board itself.&" +
        "0Swift: You can use the Arrow Keys to move the highlighted box around the board." +
        "0Swift: Each square on the board can be filled in by pressing the Z Key." +
        "0Swift: The idea is to fill in the correct squares. This will create an image which is the invention." +
        "0Swift: You use the numbers around the board to determine what squares to fill in.&" +
        "0Swift: You read the numbers from the left to right, or top to bottom." +
        "0Swift: The size of the number tells you how many connecting squares to fill in.&" +
        "0Swift: If it is one then you fill in one square, but what if it is greater than one?" +
        "0Swift: If the number is three you fill in three squares that are NEXT to each other.&" +
        "0Swift: The numbers on the left correspond to filling squares horizontally.&" +
        "0Swift: The numbers on the top correspond to filling squares vertically.&" +
        "0Swift: But what if there are multiple numbers in each column?&" +
        "0Swift: You fill in the first number then leave a space then fill in the second number.&" +
        "0Swift: The space between each number can vary. Sometimes it can be five spaces between each number." +
        "0Swift: But the leftmost/topmost number number will always be before the rightmost/bottommost." +
        "0Swift: Sometimes you can guess where numbers might be placed." +
        "0Swift: Other times you might know for sure a number does not go in a location.&" +
        "0Swift: This could be because there is zero in the column. Meaning nothing to fill in.&" +
        "0Swift: You can cross out the square by pressing the X key." +
        "0Swift: Crossing out squares helps you remember you should not fill the square in." +
        "0Swift: If you try to fill in a square that should not be filled in it will correct it.&" +
        "0Swift: It will autocorrect your mistake. So you can only fill in squares you are meant to." +
